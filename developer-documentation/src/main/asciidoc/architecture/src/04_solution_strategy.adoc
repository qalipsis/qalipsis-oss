== Solution Strategy

=== Top-level components

Evolue contains six components, responsible for the different aspects of the application:

. Head: Web server for testers to drive the test campaigns and browse the metrics and dashboards.
It also orchestrates the factory to coordinate the overall execution.
. Factory: Daemon in charge of analyzing, preparing and running the scenarios steps, generating the load by simulating the users or devices using the targeted system to test.
. Messaging platform: Used only when Evolue is deployed as a cluster, in order to transport data between heads and factories as well as between the factories themselves.
. Time-Series storage: One or more servers to manage and host the metrics.
. Configuration database: One or more RDMS server to host the configuration.
. Cache: One or more servers to share the cached data among all the factories.

==== Standalone deployment

For very simple use cases and light load, it is possible to deploy all the components as a standalone application containing all the components.

All the components run as a single process of their own and factories selectors are ignored.

As all the components will run in the same JVM (apart from the Time-Series storage, which can be either embedded or isolated), the messaging consists of a set of Kotlin broadcast channels.

The Cache component is a set of Caffeine cache, to be configured for each scenario as heap or non-heap stack.

Finally, the database is an embedded persistent Apache Derby.

==== Cluster

To simulate middle to heavy load and make Evolue resilient to failures, it is encouraged to deploy it as a cluster, in which all the components are distinct processes deployed on distinct servers.
Factories and head can be added to increase computing capabilities.
Servers can be virtual machines or even containers.
It is not necessary to use physical machines.

An example of configuration for a cluster consists of:

* One or more heads, potentially behind a HTTP load-balancer,
* Three or more factories,
* A cluster of Redis nodes or Apache Kafka brokers as a messaging platform,
* A time-series cluster with its associated GUI,
* A cluster of RDMS for the configuration,
* A cluster of Redis nodes for the shared cache.

==== Geographical redundancy

Geographical redundancy plays an important role when factories are distributed over several continents and aims at reducing the overall latency by keeping the data near the consumers.

While some platforms support mirroring and geographical redundancy, it might be required to use or develop specific tools to distribute data among different clusters for others.

=== API and Communication

Communications in Evolue use the https://kafka.apache.org/protocol[Apache Kafka protocol] as a model:

* Each feature is described as an API.
* Each API is versioned and several versions are supported by heads and factories to allow backward compatibility.
* The handshake between factories and heads allows to validate the compliance of the supported versions.
* Broadcasted messages from the head will always use the minimal common version.
* Each sent message contains the following routing headers:
** API key
** API version
** Correlation ID to match requests and responses
** Factories selectors as integers

If the messaging platform does not support native headers, a byte array is concatenated to the payload, containing the following:

* Size of the header in bytes (`uint16`, maximal: 65â€¯535), allowing to later add fields and maintain backward compatibility
* API key (`uint16`)
* API version (`uint16`)
* Correlation ID (`int32`)
* Room for later enhancements

If the messaging platform does not support binary (like Redis), the header is concatenated as a base 64 string.

=== Development process and quality validation

Source code is stored on Github and built with Github actions.
Features and fixes are developed and built on specific branches based upon either the head one or a given release (candidate) for fixes already promoted versions.

Head branch is nightly built and analyzed by SonarQube standard rules.

New releases are made public every three months, except for critical fixes, which can happen anytime on decision of the team.
Source code of each release is tagged with the number of the version.

Release notes are published on the website https://evolue.io and in the README.md file to make it accessible to Github users.
Breaking changes are listed first if any.
