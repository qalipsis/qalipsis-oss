== What's new

Well, actually everything is new in QALIPSIS.

Major changes of releases will be visible here.

With the current draft version ({revnumber}), you can create scenarios with different branches, even running with a lot of minions.

Many core steps and plugins will help you to fire load on your systems and feed QALIPSIS with data to verify.

QALIPSIS runs standalone, history of events and metrics can be either logged or saved in Elasticsearch.

Next evolutions will bring you much more plugins, steps for statistics and QALIPSIS as a cluster. Stay tune!
