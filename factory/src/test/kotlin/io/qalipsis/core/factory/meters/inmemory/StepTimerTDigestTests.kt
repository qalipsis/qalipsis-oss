    /**
     ******* SUMMARY *******
     *
     * With these investigations and findings I would suggest the following:
     *
     * Firstly, we save the data in milliseconds as it reduces the bulk of a single data value and forces our data to be
     * within a certain range that is ideal for the compression factor we have chosen, 100.0.
     *
     * Secondly it enables us use a lower compression factor. The lower the compression factor
     * the more accurate the results.
     *
     * Finally, I would recommend we switch to creating the T-Digest instance with the mergingDigest
     * since it is a much simpler and flexible digest and more widely used compared to the
     * AVLDigest which is much more complex to implement and understand.
     * The mergingDigest also fixed the problems with the test, so I don't really see any issues preventing us from using it.
     *
