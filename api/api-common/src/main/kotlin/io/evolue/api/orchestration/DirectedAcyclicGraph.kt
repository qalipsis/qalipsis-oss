/**
 * <p>
 * The Directed Acyclic Graph (or DAG) is a representation of consecutive or parallel vertices for each of the steps
 * to perform locally on a single factory. It supports fan-in (one vertex has several direct ancestors) and fan-out
 * (one vertex is direct ancestor of several ones). However, a limitation exists on the construction of the
 * DAGs: a vertex/step cannot be direct descendant of a transitive ancestor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since for technical and security reason some steps cannot be run anywhere (like reading a database or accessing
 * a protected resource), the DAGs of a single minion can be distributed and executed on different factories.
 * A scenario is composed of at least one or more DAGs.
